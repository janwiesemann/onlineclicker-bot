# onlinecklicker-bot

This is a small C# project to annoy our professor. Accidentally, he is the one who created onlinecklicker.org. I like his lectures, but I also like to annoy people.

## **Disclaimer!**
**You are using this program at your own risk. Please be gentle and do not overuse it. After all, you are probably using onlinecklicker.org in a lecture!**

## Using it
This is a dotnet solution. It's using .NET 6. If you want to use it, you need to compile it yourself. There are multiple tutorials available.

Everything else is easy. Just run it, enter a poll ID, select some other stuff and you are done.
